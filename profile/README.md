bit8bytes' fundamental, inviolable Values and Beliefs are these:

- TRULY SIMPLE: Everything we develop and build must be minimized, unique, and simplified.
- MEANINGFUL: All things we develop and build—from products to relationships—will be driven by goodness.
- DEEPLY HONEST: We truly believe that honesty and transparency will deepen our relationships with employees and customers and empower them to do the same.

These Core Values and Beliefs form our following Purpose: _"We exist to develop simple, seucre, and lightweight things."_

We are driven by these values. Therefore, our Mission until 2034 is: _"To become a truly great software company."_

This means that we:

- Have meaningful projects that make the world a better place—inside our company and outside, for our customers and friends.
- Have processes and structures in place that allow us to focus on relationships rather than chaos.
- Spend our money on the well-being of our employees and friends, helping them with all our heart.
